# WLJS-Editor
**A cell editor for wolfram-frontend project written in JS with Codemirror 6. Support mathematical expressions rendered inline, Mathematica's boxes and many more...**

__This is a core component of [Wolfram JS Frontend](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend) project__
For now it might not be very usefull being used separately from the frontend. However, it is planned to develop its independency and then apply it as an advanced syntax-highlighter with all syntax sugar on websites/blogs, where the demonstartion of Mathematica's 2D input form is needed.

If you are interested in a Mathematica mode for CodeMirror 6, please see [repo](https://github.com/JerryI/codemirror6-mathematica-sugar).
